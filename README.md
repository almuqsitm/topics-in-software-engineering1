# Project Proposal: UniDoc

Over the years in college, different professors tend to use different platforms to upload their documents for classes. Before we had Blackboard and now we have Broghtspace and other professors prefer using other platforms. What UniDoc allows users to do is gather all documents in every single platform and then display them in one single application. This solves the issue of having to go to different applications for different classes. UniDoc will need the ability to go to different platforms and exctract all the data or documents that professors upload for class.


# Potential Users

The inital target for this is college students and high schoolers. Depending on how the application works, UniDoc may be able to go beyond college classes by automating the extraction of data or documents for specific websites or platforms.
